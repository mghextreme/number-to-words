Developed by Matias Henschel ([@mghextreme](https://github.com/mghextreme/)) based on the idea from Viraj Nalawade ([@viraj351](https://github.com/viraj351/)) from [UIPath Connect](https://connect.uipath.com/community/project/100c-numbers-to-words-converter).  
The conversion code is adapted from [an article at Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-number-to-words/) by Narendra Kangralkar.
